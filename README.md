# Horiseon Code Refactor Challenge

### User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

### Description

In taking on this challenge for the Horiseon team, multiple changes were made to the website in an effort to achieve the user's main goal and also clean up the website as a whole for any future work. Some key highlights of major changes that were made are as follows:
* Added alt tags to every image 
* Added a descriptive title
* Added more precise semantic tags
* Organized and consolidated the CSS Stylesheet
* Fixed broken link on the navigation bar
* Spaced and indented the html file to allow for easier digestion
* Commented throughout both the html and css files

Along the way there were a few roadblocks that can be investigated through the commit history. Some as pesky and frustrating as a missing closing tag.
